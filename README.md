abide_univariate
==============================

A univariate analysis of heterogeneity of functional connectivity in the ABIDE dataset.

`asdfc` is the python package that contains the code
`scripts` are the scripts that call the functions in `asdfc`
Some other things are not part of this repo since they are either too big or cannot be publicly shared. Most importantly is `data` that contains the raw and processed data. Overall the repo includes all steps from the preprocessed data to the final results.
